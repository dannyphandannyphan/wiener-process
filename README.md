# wiener-process

This is a project in which I investigate how I can model stock prices using a Wiener Process (otherwise known as Brownian motion). In this, I essentially detail how a Wiener Process works, how one can code it, and I investigate certain effects such as drift and volatility. As well as this I have created a Geometric Brownian Process which assumes a constant volatility, as well as what is known as a "Stochastic Volatility Model" by assuming a volatility that also varies like a Wiener process.
